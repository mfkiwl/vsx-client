Nearist greatly accelerates big data searches through a revolutionary new hardware platform specifically engineered to handle the computationally demanding task of performing Nearest Neighbor Search on vector representations of contentâ€”enabling your search routines to deliver results several orders of magnitude faster than anything else on the market.


## Structure
This repository contains Nearist's Client API for interacting with Nearist servers remotely, along with example code demonstrating different uses and applications.

- `/python/src` contains code for connecting to Nearist servers and transforming data into a format compatible with Nearist hardware

The rest of the repository provides example code for applications of Nearist hardware:

- `/datasets` contains code for creating datasets 
- `/benchmarks` contains code for running and benchmarking Nearest Neighbor searches using traditional hardware 
- `/python/examples` contains code for running Nearest Neighbor searches using Nearist servers



## Preliminaries

You will have to obtain an API key in order to gain access to Nearist servers. 

Once you have done this, make sure to add the /python/src/ directory to your PYTHONPATH and to update the scripts in `python/examples` to include the API access key and supplied IP address.

## Example: MNIST

To show how Nearist works, we will run through the provided code to perform Nearest Neighbors classification of the MNIST dataset. 

The `/datasets/MNIST/` directory contains instructions and code for generating the data that we will run on Nearist hardware. (Alternatively, you can skip this step and download the generated datasets directly from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tr-q_uhg6PVuQKIwnLDRMtRsrG2oyS8C)). The README explains that we first train a convolutional neural network on the MNIST image classification task, and then use the trained network to transform raw images into 1024-dimensional vectors. We then convert these vectors of float data into vectors of integer data for use on Nearist hardware. This is accomplished by running:

`python mnist_feature_extraction.py` 

and then: 

`python map_to_integers.py`

You should now have the h5 datasets stored in your `data` folder.

The `/benchmarks/MNIST/` directory contains instructions and code for testing the accuracy and time of a Nearest Neighbors Classifier on CPU and GPU hardware under a variety of distance metrics (L1, L2, etc.), datatypes (uint8, float, etc.), and software packages (annoy, scikit-learn, etc.). For example, you can test the performance of a scikit-learn classifier under a variety of metrics by running:

`python run_classification_metrics.py`

The `/python/examples/MNIST/` directory contains instructions and code for running the Nearest Neighbors Classifier on Nearist hardware. After updating the script with the details of your API access key, run:

`python run_classification.py`

This will return the elapsed time and accuracy of the Nearest Neighbors Classifier using Nearist hardware.
