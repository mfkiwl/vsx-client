# Word2Vec Analogies Benchmark

In this example, we run the Word2Vec analogies task on Nearist hardware.

## Running the Example
You'll be running the example using a remote connection to a server appliance in our datacenter.

You'll need the following in order to run the exmaple:

* The example dataset files (see below)
* The Nearist classes on your Python Path.
* The API access key generated for your user account.
* An active rental session and the IP address of your reserved Nearist server appliance.

_Make sure to update your copy of the example code with your API key and the provided IP address before running. Additionally, be sure to add /python/src/ to your PYTHONPATH._

### Required Files
In order to run the example `run_analogies.py`, you will need the `Google_word2vec_analogies_uint8_8std.h5`. See `/datasets/word2vec_analogies/` for how to create these files.
